Breakout 
========

A simple breakout clone that I made in order to teach
myself about python, pygame, and game development.

**Controls:** 
- Use mouse to click on menu buttons
- left arrow: moves paddle left
- right arrow: moves paddle right
- hold p: pauses the game
- esc: quits to main menu

###Installation
Download the zip file and extract the contents. From the game
directory, execute breakout.py on the command line to run the
game. Alternatively on linux, double click the breakout.desktop
icon in a file browser to launch the game.
